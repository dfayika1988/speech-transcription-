Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen and APAP, is a medication used to treat pain and fever.[1] It is typically used for mild to moderate pain relief.[1] There is mixed evidence for its use to relieve fever in children.[11][12] It is often sold in combination with other medications, such as in many cold medications.[1] Paracetamol is also used for severe pain, such as cancer pain and pain after surgery, in combination with opioid pain medication.[13] It is typically used either by mouth or rectally, but is also available by injection into a vein.[1][14] Effects last between 2 to 4 hours.[14]

Paracetamol is generally safe at recommended doses.[15] The recommended maximum daily dose for an adult is 3 or 4 grams.[16][17] Higher doses may lead to toxicity, including liver failure.[1] Serious skin rashes may rarely occur.[1] It appears to be safe during pregnancy and when breastfeeding.[1] In those with liver disease, it may still be used, but in lower doses.[18] It is classified as a mild analgesic.[14] It does not have significant anti-inflammatory activity.[19] How it works is not entirely clear.[19]

Paracetamol was first made in 1877.[20] It is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever in both the United States and Europe.[21] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, which lists the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[22] Paracetamol is available as a generic medication with trade names including Tylenol and Panadol, among others.[23] The wholesale price in the developing world is less than US$ 0.01 per dose.[24] In the United States, it costs about US$0.04 per dose.[25] In 2019, it was the 17th most prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 29 million prescriptions.[26]
